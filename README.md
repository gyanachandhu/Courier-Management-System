# Courier-Management-System
# Introduction
 This is my first internship project.This project mainly focuses on our college problem currently the students are facing.This project involves creating a website where orders from various e-commerce sites and food delivery apps can be consolidated. Instead of relying on designated individuals to manage orders, the system will handle them centrally. This initiative aims to streamline order processing, particularly benefiting college students.

# Problem 
Students must collect their orders from the main gate of our college when ordering from e-commerce websites or food delivery apps. Delivery personnel are not permitted to enter the college premises. If a student is in class or in the middle of an examination, the delivery person must wait until the student is available to receive the order. In cases where the student is unable to come or answer the delivery person's call, the delivery may be returned.
   
# Solution 
 We devised a solution to address the issue mentioned earlier. Our team developed a website where students can submit their orders. Instead of students individually collecting orders, a designated individual is responsible for collecting all the orders. At the end of the day, this person delivers the orders to each respective student.
